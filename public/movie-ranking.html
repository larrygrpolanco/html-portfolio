<h3>No Regrets for Our Youth (1946)</h3>
<p>
  Inspired by several real-life incidents, No Regrets for Our Youth is an
  intelligent and balanced drama about wavering ideologies and personal
  allegiances set between 1933-46, the years of imperial Japan’s increasing
  militarisation through to its wartime defeat.

  Yukie is the privileged daughter of a Kyoto University law professor who is
  controversially removed from his post for his leftist beliefs. The film
  portrays her relationships over the years with 2 of his former students, both
  rival for her affections, and her love affair and ensuing marriage to one of
  them, who is arrested for his anti-government activities and subsequently
  disappears from public view.

<p>
  Kurosawa’s oeuvre is not particularly regarded for its focus on sympathetic
  female characters, but the central turn by Setsuko Hara (better known for her
  work with Yasujiro Ozu) in his fifth feature (and first of the postwar period)
  showcases another side to the director, and also counts as his most overtly
  political work.

<h3>Scandal (1950)</h3>
<p>
  The first of 2 films Kurosawa made for the Shochiku studio (alongside the
  Dostoevsky adaptation The Idiot in 1951), this punchy social drama takes a
  righteous swipe at the gutter press, as Toshiro Mifune’s up-and-coming painter
  is snapped by the paparazzi while sitting on a hotel balcony with a famous
  singer (played by Yoshiko Yamaguchi), the photo inspiring a fabricated story
  in a popular gossip magazine. Needless to say, the outraged artist refuses to
  take things lying down and vows to take the magazine’s editor to court.
</p>

<p>
  A lesser-known work from the master, Scandal is nonetheless worth checking out
  not only as an example of Kurosawa’s technical virtuosity and strong
  compositional approach, but for its critique of some of the less palatable
  aspects of westernisation.
